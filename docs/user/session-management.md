# Session Management Guide

PeakPath's session management system allows you to maintain multiple coaching profiles and preserve your conversation history across visits.

3. **Recovered Sessions**: Restored from interrupted uploads

## üöÄ Creating New Sessions

### Multiple Profiles
Create separate sessions for:
- **Different Time Periods**: Retaking CliftonStrengths over time

- **Manual Transfer**: Use export/import for device transfer

### Mobile vs Desktop
- **Same Features**: Full session management on all devices
- **Responsive Design**: Session interface adapts to screen size
- **Touch Optimized**: Mobile gestures work for session switching

### Sharing Sessions
To use sessions on multiple devices:
1. **Export from Device 1**: Download session JSON
2. **Transfer File**: Email, cloud storage, or direct transfer
3. **Import to Device 2**: Upload JSON to recreate session
4. **Manual Sync**: Repeat process to keep devices updated

## üîç Troubleshooting Sessions

### Session Won't Load
**Possible Causes**:
- Browser storage corruption
- Session data incomplete
- Browser compatibility issue

**Solutions**:
1. **Refresh Browser**: Try reloading the page
2. **Clear Cache**: Clear browser cache and cookies
3. **Different Browser**: Test in another browser
4. **Recovery Mode**: Use session recovery tools

### Missing Sessions
**Possible Causes**:
- Browser data cleared
- Different browser/device
- Private browsing mode
- Storage quota exceeded

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Browser Settings**: Verify data storage allowed
2. **Import Backup**: Use previously exported session data
3. **Re-upload PDF**: Create new session from original PDF

### Session Data Corrupted
**Automatic Recovery**:
- System detects corruption
- Attempts automatic repair
- Fallback to last known good state
- User notified of recovery attempt

**Manual Recovery**:
1. **Export Partial Data**: Save what's recoverable
2. **Delete Corrupted Session**: Remove damaged session
3. **Re-import Clean Data**: Import recovered portions
4. **Re-upload PDF**: Start fresh if necessary

### Performance Issues
**Large Session Management**:
- **Archive Old Sessions**: Export and delete inactive sessions
- **Limit Active Sessions**: Keep 5-10 active sessions maximum
- **Clear Chat History**: Remove old conversations if needed
- **Browser Optimization**: Ensure browser has adequate storage

## üìä Storage Usage Monitoring

### Checking Storage Usage
```
Session Menu > Storage Info
- Total storage used
- Storage per session
- Available space remaining
- Cleanup recommendations
```

### Storage Optimization
- **Regular Cleanup**: Delete unused sessions monthly
- **Export Important Data**: Save key insights externally
- **Compress Large Sessions**: System automatically optimizes storage
- **Monitor Usage**: Check storage usage regularly

## üéØ Best Practices

### Organization
1. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, meaningful session names
2. **Regular Cleanup**: Delete unused sessions monthly
3. **Backup Important Sessions**: Export valuable conversations
4. **Consistent Naming**: Use naming convention (e.g., "2024-Q1-Work")

### Workflow
1. **One Session per Assessment**: Don't mix different PDF reports
2. **Rename Immediately**: Give sessions meaningful names after creation
3. **Regular Review**: Check session list monthly
4. **Export Key Insights**: Save important coaching conversations

### Sharing
1. **Export for Coaches**: Share session data with mentors/coaches
2. **Team Comparisons**: Export multiple profiles for team analysis
3. **Progress Tracking**: Export sessions over time to track development
4. **Backup Strategy**: Regular exports as backup
