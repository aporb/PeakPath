# Performance Optimization

*This documentation is currently being developed.*

PeakPath implements several performance optimizations and provides guidance for maintaining optimal performance.

## Current Optimizations

### Frontend Performance
- **Next.js 15**: App Router with automatic code splitting
- **React 18**: Concurrent features and optimizations
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS with purging
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js automatic image optimization
- **Bundle Analysis**: Built-in bundle analyzer

### API Performance
- **Serverless Functions**: Vercel edge functions for low latency
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time AI responses via SSE
- **Error Handling**: Efficient error responses
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in Claude API rate limiting

### Storage Performance
- **Local Storage**: Fast browser-based data persistence
- **Compression**: Automatic data compression for storage
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of expired sessions
- **Cross-tab Sync**: Efficient multi-tab synchronization

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics to Track
- Page load times (target: < 3 seconds)
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- API response times
- Bundle size

### Tools for Monitoring
- Browser DevTools Performance tab
- Vercel Analytics
- Web Vitals monitoring
- Bundle analyzer reports

## Optimization Opportunities

**ðŸ“ˆ Areas for Improvement:**
Performance audit findings include:
- Bundle size optimization opportunities
- Code splitting improvements
- Image optimization enhancements
- Memory usage optimizations

## Best Practices

### For Developers
- Use React.memo() for expensive components
- Implement proper loading states
- Optimize images and assets
- Monitor bundle size regularly
- Use proper dependency management

### For Users
- Keep browser updated
- Use stable internet connection for AI features
- Clear browser data periodically
- Close unused tabs for better performance
